# The Ant Farm

The Ant Farm is a program that aims to simplify the process of PCB-making using CNC machines.  
In this software we included both the necessary CAM features and the CNC machine control capabilities, trying to simplify the user operations as much as possible.  

## Actual status  
This software is a pre-alpha, meaning that there are no warranties and safety of the software and its use.
Up to now, the application is compatible only with CNC machines using GRBL v1.1 firmware, and it has been tested using only some gerber and drill files generated using Autodesk's Eagle and KiCad EDA.  
If you want to have some more information about the actual implemented features, you could watch this video:
